<H1>Spring-0</H1>
<H2>Self-Critique</H2>
For my role, i was the project manager for the group and aside from making sure that the presentation was delivered,  I also was responsible for making the team chat, the central repo, kanban board, and team charter document. 
While I believe that overall I did a good job, there were some things that could have been done better such as doing more research on kanban boards to make them more efficent, seeing if there were better options than github to host a repo and refrencing back some of the project management documents to make a better team charter.

<h2>Group-Critique</h2>
Our group worked well and each member contributed to the outcome of the first sprint. Endri Baci was responsible for making sure that about,md item was filled and Rohan Jose was responsible for the readme.md. Mahmood did the wireframing for the project and we all worked on the erd diagram.
We all did our part and made sure that we contributed and finished all our items in a timely manner.
